# aws-terraform-ec2-deployment
**Title:** AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

Description:

Designed and implemented a robust and scalable web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The project included:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Created a dedicated VPC to isolate and manage network resources.

Subnets: Configured one public and one private subnet, optimizing resource accessibility and security.

EC2 Instance: Deployed an EC2 instance in the public subnet to host a web server, ensuring high availability for user access.

Load Balancer: A application load balancer to distribute traffic between the instances.

Security Groups: Implemented security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring adherence to security best practices.

Infrastructure as Code: Leveraged Terraform to automate the infrastructure provisioning process, enabling version control and repeatability.

By showcasing this project, I demonstrated proficiency in cloud services, infrastructure management, and automation techniques, as well as a solid understanding of AWS networking, security, and best practices
